            <h2 class="heading">Depressed Darth</h2>
            <p>His wife dies so the natural response is to join the man who manipulated him into pushing away 
                everyone who cared about him so they could rule the Galaxy together as the Empire. Because of course.</p>

            <p>Anyway here's a collection of some of the people he left to die or just completely 
                abandoned because he wanted to save them:</p>

            <h2 class="heading">Dead</h2>
            <p>He does eventually do the die but he keeps on living because Disney need to make more money from him 
                due to their sequel trilogy being the worst piece of Star Wars content ever created.</p>
